      <p>      I am very interested in keeping active and fit hence I enjoy regularly attending the gym and
        working out. This keeps me in a routine and instills a sense of discipline which encourages me
        to stay dedicated, ultimately allowing me to see visible results. I also enjoy sports activities such
        as swimming and cycling which keeps me focused and motivated. Being outdoors is a passion
        of mine, with adventuring in particular being something that brings excitement and enjoyment to
        my daily life as I get the chance to learn and experience new things.</p> <br>
